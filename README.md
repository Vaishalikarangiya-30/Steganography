# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes **image-based steganography** to securely embed confidential messages within images. The hidden data can only be accessed through a **passcode**, ensuring **privacy and security** from unauthorized users. It offers an effective way to transmit sensitive information discreetly.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Main programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV** – For image processing and pixel-level operations.
- **OS Module** – To manage file handling and system interactions.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Hidden Message Encoding** – Conceals text within image pixels invisibly.  
✅ **Passcode Authentication** – Ensures only verified users can decrypt the hidden data.  
✅ **Image Integrity** – Maintains the visual appearance of images without noticeable alterations.  
✅ **Fast & Lightweight** – Efficient processing with minimal resource consumption.  

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure Python is installed, then install OpenCV:
```bash
pip install opencv-python 
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Program
To **encrypt a message** into an image:
```bash
python stego.py
```
